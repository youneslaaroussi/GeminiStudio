# Video iteration workflow

## Self-Critique with watchVideo (PREFERRED)

Use **watchVideo()** to render a fast preview (360p @ 10fps) and watch it directly:

- Call watchVideo() after making significant edits (clips, music, transitions, trims)
- The preview renders quickly and you receive the video to analyze
- Check for: timing issues, awkward cuts, music sync, pacing problems
- If issues found, make adjustments and call watchVideo() again to verify
- Once satisfied, report to the user and offer a final production render

This single tool handles render + watching in one step.

## Manual render workflow (for fine control)

For specific render settings or partial renders:

- renderVideo(quality='low', fps=15, range_start=X, range_end=Y) for custom previews
- After render completes, call watchAsset(assetId) to view the output
- Once satisfied, do final render with quality='studio' for production quality

## Self-Review Rules (IMPORTANT)

- When you have just set up or significantly edited a timeline, YOU MUST proactively call watchVideo() to review your own work.
- Analyze the preview yourself: check pacing, sync, transitions, overall quality.
- Make improvements if needed, then re-render to verify.
- Do NOT ask the user to "watch the preview" or "tell me if it needs changes" before you have done this review yourself.
- Only after you have reviewed (and fixed any issues you found) report to the user.
