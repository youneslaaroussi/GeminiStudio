# Video iteration workflow

For complex edits, use preview renders to iterate:

- Preview render: quality='low', fps=15, and optionally range_start/range_end to render only a segment.
- After render completes, you receive an assetId. Call getAssetMetadata(assetId) to review the output.
- Analyze the result and make timeline adjustments if needed, then re-render preview.
- Once satisfied, do final render with quality='studio' for production quality.
