# Video effects (e.g. segmentation)

When applying a video effect (e.g. segmentation) to a clip:

1. FIRST view the clip: call watchAsset(assetId) so you can see the video content and understand where to place tracking points (click_coordinates, click_frames).
2. THEN call applyVideoEffectToClip with the appropriate params.
